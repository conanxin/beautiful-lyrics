All Kinds Of Everything 
========================

Snowdrops and daffodils  
butterflies and bees  
sailboats and fishermen  
things of the sea  
wishing-wells  
wedding bells  
early morning dew  
all kinds of everything remind me of you

Seagulls and aeroplanes  
things of the sky  
winds that go howlin'  
breezes that sigh  
city sights  
neon lights  
grey skies or blue  
all kinds of everything remind me of you

Summertime  
wintertime  
spring and autumn too  
Monday  
Tuesday every day  
I think of you.  
Dances  
romances  
things of the night  
sunshine and holidays  
postcards to write  
Budding trees  
autumn leaves  
a snowflake or two  
all kinds of everything remind me of you.

Summertime  
wintertime  
spring and autumn too  
seasons will never change  
the way that I love you.  

Dances  
romances  
things of the night  
sunshine and holidays  
postcards to write  
Budding trees  
autumn leaves  
a snowflake or two  
all kinds of everything remind me of you.  
All kinds of everything remind me of you.
