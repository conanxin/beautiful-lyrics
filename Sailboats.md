Sailboats 
==========

Sailboats wish that they were stars,  
Floating softly in the sky  
Among our dreams that pay goodbye

Moving through transparent space,   
Drifting through the stratosphere  
And onward 'till they disappear

These continents from overhead  
Look like tiny paper shapes  
Intricately set in place

Below the misty mountain clouds  
Theres a lovely silver bay  
Where sunset sailors often hideaway

Scuba diver in the lock,   
Speedboat driver on the dock  
Sailplane pilot in the blue take me up there with you  
The world looks brighter from this high altitude

I was walking through the trees (Sailboats wish they were stars)  
And I was swimming through the sea (Cause they don't know who they are)  
I was falling through the air  
When it hit me right there...  
My eyes are tired; I don't even care

An airplane carried me to bed,   
Where i slept above the coast   
And dreamt I had become a ghost

I sail above the frozen peaks,  
Deep in cold cathedral caves  
Across the hills and far beyond the waves

Take the car on the lawn  
Fly the jet to the sun  
And bring the spacecraft  
'n soon while I play chess with the moon  
I feel like sleeping through this cold afternoon

Once in 1964 (Sailboats wish they were stars)  
An actress ran on the shore (Cause they don't know who they are)

And though you'll never return,  
I love you Audrey Hepburn  
Sometimes I can see your face in the crowd

There are sailboats throughout this brilliant sky  
But you cannot pick them out if you can't fly  
I'm glad the Earth doesn't care  
If I go up there  
If you want to just ask me and I will take you along..
