At The Beginning
=================

(DONNA LEWIS)

We were strangers  
Starting out on a journey  
Never dreaming  
What we'd have to go through  
Now here we are  
And I'm suddenly standing  
At the beginning with you  

(RICHARD MARX)

No one told me  
I was going to find you  
Unexpected  
What you did to my heart  
When I lost hope  
You were there to remind me  
This is the start  

And...

Life is a road  
And I want to keep going  
Love is a river  
I wanna keep flowing  
Life is a road  
Now and forever  
Wonderful journey  

I'll be there  
When the world stops turning  
I'll be there  
When the storm is through  
In the end I wanna be standing  
At the beginning with you  

(DONNA LEWIS)  

We were strangers  
On a crazy adventure  
(RICHARD MARX)  
Never dreaming  
How our dreams would come true  
(BOTH)  
Now here we stand  
Unafraid of the future  
At the beginning with you  

And...  

Life is a road  
And I want to keep going  
Love is a river  
I wanna keep flowing  
Life is a road  
Now and forever  
Wonderful journey  

I'll be there  
When the world stops turning  
I'll be there  
When the storm is through  
In the end I wanna be standing  
At the beginning with you  

I knew there was somebody somewhere  
Like me alone in the dark  
Now I know my dream will live on  
I've been waiting so long  
Nothing's gonna tear us apart  

And...

(RICHARD MARX)

Life is a road  
And I want to keep going  
Love is a river  
I wanna keep flowing  
(BOTH)  
Life is a road   
Now and forever  
Wonderful journey  

I'll be there  
When the world stops turning  
I'll be there  
When the storm is through  
In the end I wanna be standing  
At the beginning with you  

(RICHARD MARX)(Hey ay ay)  

(BOTH)

Life is a road and I wanna keep going  
Love is a river I wanna keep going on....  
(DONNA LEWIS)  
Starting out on a journey  
(BOTH)  
Life is a road and I wanna keep going  
Love is river I wanna keep flowing  
In the end I wanna be standing  
At the beginning with you.  

(DONNA LEWIS)(Hmmmmm)
