You Can't Say
===============

You can say, all things must end  
You can smile and even pretend  
And you can turn and walk away so easily  
But you can't say, you don't love me anymore  
You can dream of what might have been  
You can cry for what won't pass again  
And you can say, there's every reason you should leave  
But you can't say, you don't love me anymore  
You can say, I'm right, you're wrong  
You can make your plans to find somebody else  
But I can't believe you can carry on  
We know what should be said  
But you can't find the words instead  
You say, all things must end  
You can smile and even pretend  
And you can turn and say, you're leaving me for good  
But you can't say, you don't love me anymore  
And you can turn and say, you're leaving me for good  
But you can't say, you don't love me  
First just say, you don't love me anymore
