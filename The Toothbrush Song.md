The Toothbrush Song
=====================
There's two toothbrushes standing in a jar  
And only one of them has been used in a while  
And yet I don't know why, why it still remains  
I guess it still exists to take away the stain  
Of the troubled times that we went through  
I guess it's just the way I get close to you

There's two toothbrushes standing in a "V"  
And what this represents is a victory to me  
'Cause when I look at them I guess they make me smile  
Because I realize why I've kept it all this while  
It's all the happy times that we went through  
I guess it's just the way I get close to you

It's all the happy times that we went through  
I guess it's just the way I get close to you

###说明：
歌词很短，应该也是首先在哪部电影中听到的。
