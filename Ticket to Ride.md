Ticket To Ride
================

I think I'm gonna be sad  
I think it's today  
Yeh  
The boy that's driving me mad  
is going away.

He's got a ticket to ride  
He's got a ticket to ride  
He's got a ticket to ride  
and he don't care.

He said that living with me  
was bringing him down  
Yeh  
He would never be free  
when I was around.

He's got a ticket to ride  
He's got a ticket to ride  
He's got a ticket to ride  
and he don't care.

Don't know why he's riding so high  
He oughta do right

He oughta do right by me  
Before he gets to saying goodbye  
He oughta do right  
He oughta do right by me

I think I'm gonna be sad  
I think it's today  
Yeh  
The boy that's driving me mad  
is going away.

He's got a ticket to ride  
He's got a ticket to ride  
He's got a ticket to ride  
and he don't care  
he don't care.

###说明
Carpenters的一首歌，最初的版本应该是Beatles的，不过是把She换成了He，算是一个女版和一个男版吧。
