I'll Cry Myself To Sleep
=====================

I thought that you would never leave me  
You said that we were never apart  
But now you are gone  
And I'm lonely with nothing but a broken heart

And so I cry myself to sleep  
Cry myself to sleep  
Cry myself to sleep over you  

So many little things you told me  
Made me suppose you really care  
I can't believe you could leave them  
Not after ROUGH the love we share

And so I cry myself to sleep  
Cry myself to sleep  
Cry myself to sleep over you

Every night I want to hold you tight  
Once again to try to ease the pain  
Sometimes I wished that we've never met  
There are so many things I'm trying so hard to forget

But if you find an excuse to leave me  
If you should want me back again  
You know that I shall always love you  
But no my darling until then  

I'm gonna cry myself to sleep  
Cry myself to sleep  
Cry myself to sleep over you  
Over you  
What else can I do  
I'll cry over you, over you, over you...
