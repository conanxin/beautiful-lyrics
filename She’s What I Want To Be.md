She’s What I Want To Be
=========================

Been around like a dream  
Seen the world  
or all you'd need to see  
And she wants to feel  
 
Like a star broadway lights  
On the stage  
for all the world to see  
She's what I wanna be  
 
If I could live  
just a day of the life  
My eyes so bright  
shine light upon the sea  
 
She's not like me  
does whatever she wants  
Now I know she's not free  
 
Some might say if  
you could wish upon a star  
you might meet her tonight  
And there's one that will say  
 
If you stay the night you'll be  
just what you thought  
You could never be  
it's you and me  
 
Been around like a dream  
Seen the world  
or all you'd need to see  
And she wants to feel  
 
Like a star broadway lights  
On the stage  
for all the world to see  
She's what I wanna be  

###说明
电影《松子被嫌弃的一生》的插曲，这部电影很早之前就看过了，很不错。对这首歌没什么印象了。
