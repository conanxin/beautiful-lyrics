Rabbit
=========

Every sentiment hangs around  
No longer than a minute or two  
I find I keep falling for love  
But I cant seem to follow it through  

So run, little rabbit, run  
Run, little rabbit, run  

I leave one good hand on the wheel  
Been counting mile markers for days  
Everything falls further behind  
I can disappear in several ways  

So run, little rabbit, run  
Run, little rabbit, run  
Run, little rabbit, run  

Sleep through the morning  
Don't wake me up  
Don't wake me up  
Sleep through the morning  
One little man to one mighty sun  

Try to break away from yourself  
Throw your broken bones in a heap  
All your blood and guts are exposed  
Your spirit has been begging to leave  

So run, little rabbit, run  
Run, little rabbit, run  
So run, little rabbit, run  
Run, little rabbit, run
