From The Heart
===============

I know you've heard these words a hundred  
Other times before  
And you've been hurt and so your heart  
Has chose to close the door  
Love broke your heart and brought you lies  
Look in my eyes  
You'll see a love that's deep and true  
Tender and strong and all for you  
You can trust this love  
Honest, that's the honest truth

From the heart  
I'm giving you everything, everything  
From the heart  
I promises you that I'll be there  
I'll be there to love you  
From the soul  
I'm showing you all I feel all I feel is  
From the heart  
From the heart

I will protect you and respect you  
And be all you need  
And when you reach for love  
You'll only need to reach for me  
These arms will never let you down  
They're staying around  
I'll walk with you through every storm  
I'll keep you safe I'll keep you warm  
And you'll have no doubt  
You're the one I'm living for

From the heart  
I'm giving you everything, everything  
From the heart  
I promises you that I'll be there  
I'll be there to love you  
From the soul  
I'm showing you all I feel all I feel is  
From the heart  
From the heart

I will buy the love you need  
Just trust my touch, believe in me  
I'll never make you cry, givin' all I got with  
All I got inside

From the heart  
I'm giving you everything, everything  
From the heart  
I promises you that I'll be there  
I'll be there to love you  
From the soul  
I'm showing you all I feel all I feel is  
From the heart  
From the heart

Hmm? from the heart, from the heart
