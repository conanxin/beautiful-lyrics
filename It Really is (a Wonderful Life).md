It Really is (a Wonderful Life)
===============================

The snow has fallen like it does every year  
The tree I know so well is aglow  
And folks are filled up with the usual holiday cheer  
As they hang pretty lights and mistletoe

Oh, but this year is different for you and for me  
Our own little miracle, on our own little street  
Never before have I loved 'Silent Night' so  
But now that you're here by my side

Baby, it is, baby, it is  
It really is a wonderful life

I'd never noticed that the crackle of a fire  
Makes music when accompanied by kiss  
And when did I start having dreams about pumpkin pies  
There's not a lot that's sweeter than this

Oh, but this year is better for you and for me  
Our own little miracle, on our own little street  
Never before have I loved 'Silent Night' so  
But now that you're here by my side

Baby, it is, baby it is  
It really is a wonderful life

Oh, but this year is better for you and for me  
Our own little miracle, only our own little street  
Never before have I loved 'Silent Night' so  
But now that you're here by my side  
Darling with you, by my side

Baby, it is, baby it is  
It really is a wonderful life

###说明
前几天在机场等飞机的时候听到这首歌，感觉很好，圣诞节也马上要到了，不知道什么时候会下雪了。
