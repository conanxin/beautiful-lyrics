I'm Just a Country Boy
=======================

I ain't gonna marry in the fall  
I ain't gonna marry in the spring  
'Cause I'm in love with a pretty little girl  
Who wears a diamond ring.

And I'm just a country boy  
Money have I none  
But I've got silver in the stars  
Gold in the mornin' sun  
Gold in the mornin' sun.

Never gonna kiss  
The ruby red lips  
Of the prettiest girl in town  
Never gonna ask her if she'd  
Marry me  
I know she'd turn me down.

'Cause I'm just a country boy  
Money have I none  
But I've got silver in the stars  
And gold in the mornin' sun  
Gold in the mornin' sun.

I never could afford  
A store bought ring  
With a sparkling diamond stone  
All I could afford  
Is a loving heart  
The only one I own.

'Cause I'm just a country boy  
Money have I none  
But I've got silver in the stars  
And gold in the mornin' sun  
Gold in the mornin' sun...
