Lisa Ono – My Boy
==================

First time I saw my son, I knew I was in love  
Because he was the gift I got from somewhere up above  
O wow, o yes, o joy, so joy right here in my arms  
He looks at me, I can see he's showing all his charms  
Can't remember what I do before I saw his face  
But now he's here and I can feel his amazing grace

Watching him play, somehow reminds me of myself  
Once upon a different time when I was someone else  
O me, o my, I feel so high every single day  
O yes, o lay, my lord yea yea watching my son play  
First time he'd walk detours I step in to a chance  
I took his hand and then we start it likes dance  
The first dance was so fine that I never will forget  
He held my hand so tightly that I had start dancing yet

My love, my boy, my son, my joy always keep your glow  
And know that love will be with you wherever you may go  
And if something should fall apart somewhere down the line  
Just tell me all about it and I will make it fine

I'd travel many roads before but somehow they were wrong  
And sometime we find that life is just a simple song  
Even the saddest songs ever human face  
I will always keep my son in love's magic place

###说明：
2015年的第一首歌，小野丽莎唱的，应该是改编的一首歌，唱给自己的孩子，还是一首摇篮曲。感觉很温暖。
