No One Wants Forever
=====================

If you want to be alone here with me  
You must understand my weakness  
It's the way that he left me  
And bereft me of my love without a warning  
Without mourning, almost yawning

No one wants forever anymore  
Cause no one dares to try  
No one wants endeavour like before

If you want to see the world that's in me  
You should know I'll always need him  
It's the way that I met him  
There's no way that I could possibly forget him  
Like he got me, and forgot me

No one wants forever anymore  
And no one wants to try  
No one wants endeavour like before

No one wants forever anymore  
And no one wants to be there like I know I might have been  
No one wants endeavour like before

###说明
歌词不是很长，平静、有点淡淡的哀伤。嗯，没有人相信Forever。
