Different Colored Eyes
=======================

Dreaming into the sunlight  
Bluebirds fly  
Wanting also to unwind  
And forget, finally

I know now that silence speaks  
To walk away would be so sweet  
Let me love again, please

My body grows, but my heart lays  
The weight, it's trying  
While leaves drop every autumn day  
They go down spiraling

But they don't put up a fight  
Once out of sight, they're out of mind  
So why can't i?

Walking back from work one night  
I saw a man who looked like you  
With different colored eyes  
Suddenly couldn't decide  
No, i want to walk away from your smile  
And feel okay after a while  
After a while  
After a while

今天感觉很累。嗯，新年的第二天。
